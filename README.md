brushing up it's been a few years without manual coding but I also only really learned code from using C# and unity

Quick Guide thus far...


BuyFish........ a simple script that assigns enums prices by name, and the price compounds - this is a simple thing. you can simply add more fish and its place on the enum is the point of which its price will be relative to the others.

GetTarget...... a script that's just having a name and comparing with each item in the array until it finds the target.

RatesOfChange...... a script that allows the user to select between Linear and Exponential Rates of Change. 

container....... a script that's just accumated value in containers, it's grouped accumulation.

charCount....... a script that parses through character in a string. It also reverse and list the index of the char in the string.
