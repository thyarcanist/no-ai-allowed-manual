# no-ai-allowed-manual
brushing up it's been a few years without manual coding but I also only really learned code from using C# and unity

Quick Guide thus far...


BuyFish........ a simple script that assigns enums prices by name, and the price compounds - this is a simple thing.
GetTarget...... a script that's just having a name and comparing with each item in the array until it finds the target.
RatesOfChange...... a script that allows the user to select between Linear and Exponential Rates of Change.
container....... a script that's just accumated value in containers, it's grouped accumulation.
