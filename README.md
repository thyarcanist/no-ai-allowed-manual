explanations are allowed tho!
brushing up it's been a few years without manual coding but I also only really learned code from using C# and unity. Plug and play these into:

Quick Guide thus far...


AssignFish........ a simple script that assigns enums prices by name, and the price compounds - this is a simple thing. you can simply add more fish and its place on the enum is the point of which its price will be relative to the others.

AssignFish-P2 ....... a better method than the previous script which uses a dynamic list of fish types and assigns them an ID and weight. the price is modified by the weight. Uses a fish class.

GetTarget...... a script that's just having a name and comparing with each item in the array until it finds the target.

RatesOfChange...... a script that allows the user to select between Linear and Exponential Rates of Change. 

container....... a script that's just accumated value in containers, it's grouped accumulation.

charCount....... a script that parses through character in a string. It also reverse and list the index of the char in the string.

Grids........ a script that instantiants and makes a 6x6 grid and another one that makes and populates a normal int array.

StoreMenu........ the script makes a class of MenuItem with prices, retrieves an ID from the menu as an item to select

Countdown..... a countdown program that has FizzBizz integrated into it. FizzBuzz is a patterm that can be used for error correction such as per, "3" steps check this and do that as that countdown goes.

ListArraySort.... a script that sorts divisibles into its own array and prints it out
